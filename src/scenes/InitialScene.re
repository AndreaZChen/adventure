"Highly doubt it," Anethir replies flatly. They hold up the notebook for Jaziel to read. "D'you see this symbol here?" They tap on a small scribble in the center of the page. "I've almost got this thing figured out, but this one's weird. It's right there in the center, but it's so |js}

"So when are you going to share what it is you're working on?" he says, grinning.

"I'm not entirely sure what I'm working on," Anethir replies, "but it sure is work." They frown. "These symbols right hereâ€”I wrote 'em down as fast as I could after I woke up, I think I got it all down, but I don't understandâ€”"

{js|Jaziel stares intently at the symbol. It looks like a straight line, with curls coiling around it and some sort of protrusion at the top. His mind swirls with imagery and ideas: a column of fire, a spiral staircase, a gnarled and ancient tree...?

"You'd think your all-knowing patron would be a little bit more forthcoming with these things," he says, stroking his chin. "Why the cryptic riddles?"

"First of all," Anethir replies, "not necessarily all-knowing. Or at least we don't know that It knows all. Secondly, It might not be intentionally cryptic! Maybe It doesn't even speak our languages! I dunno." They shrug. "It's always been communication through dreams and visions with S-dog, that's just how we roll.

"S-dog?" says Jaziel, raising an eye-brow.

"Yeah! You know, the Seeker. S-dog. Big S. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰"

"Urgh!" Jaziel exclaims, wincing and reflexively covering his ears. "I'm never gonna get used to that."

"Whatever it is that awaits you at the end of your path," she says coldly, "it will not play out the way you expect."

Stieletta's lip curls with disapproval. "But the price will be too high. Trust me, I know of these things. Your dealings with the demon-spawn of the abyssâ€”

"It's not a demon, it's an unspecified extraplanar being," Anethir says.

"â€”extraplanar beings of the abyss will only lead to death and destruction, for you and for all those you care about."

Anethir pouts, then quietly returns their attention to the notebook. "Implying that I care about..." they mumble, trailing off into silence.|js}

"Jaze, don't get taken in by these vile, occult magics," she says sternly. The dim light from the campfire casts her face in a dramatic glow. "There are better paths for you to travel."

Jaziel scratches the back of his head awkwardly. "You may be right," he says, after a brief pause. "But unlike our friend hereâ€”"

He reaches over to pat Anethir on the head, but Anethir swats his hand away, having already sunk back into their studies of the notebook.

"â€”er, unlike An, I have something at stake. It's not just about knowledge for knowledge's sake..."

"Of course, my lady," Jaziel replies with a smug grin. "Are you familiar with the ogre folk song 'All ye Stars'?"

"No," says Stieletta tersely.

Jaziel nods, then hefts the lute into his arms with a practiced motion. His fingers lovingly wrap around its neck, and he begins to sing as he plucks its strings:

"Spare me," she replies. Still, a very faint smile cracks across her stony face.

"As you wish," he says. Carefully, he puts the lute down on the forest floor, then lies down next to it, crossing his arms behind his head. Above him, the night sky is full of stars, and the full moon shines bright.

"You should try lying down, Stieletta. It's more comfortable "|js}

"Excellent!" Jaziel replies, beaming. "Then let us sing together, my friend! A most shitty serenade for you, my lady."

Anethir looks up from their notebook, stares at Stieletta, then at Jaziel, then at Stieletta again. "Trying to decide whether I'd rather have some peace and quiet so I can decipher these symbols, or have him keep annoying you. Leaning towards the latter."
